-  Hi yall. I'm recent Flatiron grduate with a study in Data Science. I have hopes of using my skills to make this world a better and fun place to live in. 
Right now, I'm interested in games and being "healthy". Struggle is super real.
I'm currently learning python, machine learning, sql, pandas, seaborn, nlp, etc.
